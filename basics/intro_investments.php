    <h3>Why Invest?</h3>
    <p>Investing allows your money to grow through interest, dividends, and appreciation. Unlike saving, investments help you beat inflation.</p>

    <h3>Types of Investments</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Stocks:</strong> Ownership in a company with potential for high returns.</li>
        <li><strong>Bonds:</strong> Loans to companies or governments with fixed returns.</li>
        <li><strong>Real Estate:</strong> Investing in property for rental income or appreciation.</li>
        <li><strong>Mutual Funds & ETFs:</strong> Diversified investments managed by professionals.</li>
        <li><strong>Cryptocurrency:</strong> High-risk digital assets with potential for rapid gains.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Risk vs. Reward</h3>
    <p>Investments come with risks. High returns often mean higher risk. Diversification helps balance risk.</p>

    <h3>How to Start Investing</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Define your financial goals and risk tolerance.</li>
        <li>Start with low-risk investments if you're a beginner.</li>
        <li>Invest consistently and reinvest earnings.</li>
        <li>Monitor and adjust your investments as needed.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>Investing is a long-term journey. Start small and grow your wealth!</p>
